      <p>This morning, the very first thing I did wasn’t stretching or sipping coffee… it was grabbing my phone. Five minutes of scrolling magically turned into an hour. By the time I realized, my breakfast was cold and my brain felt fried. 🙃</p>
      <p>So I decided to try a little experiment: digital detox. Honestly, notifications are more effective than alarms, but they also eat up my focus like hungry Pac-Man. No wonder I’ve been forgetful and restless lately.</p>

      <h2>🧠 Brain Reboot: Yes, It’s Real</h2>
      <p>Science says too much screen time messes with the prefrontal cortex (a.k.a. the boss of focus and emotional balance). No surprise I can’t sit still — one email, one TikTok, one half-written idea, and boom, my brain short-circuits.</p>
      <p>But here’s the cool part: the brain is flexible. Thanks to neuroplasticity, cutting down screen time lets it rewire itself:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Anxiety quiets down (my inner gossip group finally muted).</li>
        <li>Dopamine stabilizes, so I don’t crave “just one more scroll.”</li>
        <li>Mental clarity sneaks back in, like sunlight through the curtains.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>🌙 Emotional Side Effects (The Good Kind)</h2>
      <p>After just 7 days of this “digital fasting,” I noticed real changes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>45% less anxiety (okay, I didn’t measure, but it felt like it).</li>
        <li>Sleep improved — no more blue-light insomnia.</li>
        <li>Deeper conversations with friends, since I wasn’t secretly texting under the table.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Turns out, reducing screen time isn’t punishment; it’s a shortcut to mental clarity and emotional balance.</p>

    <section class="article-section">
      <h2>🔌 My New Rules (Surprisingly Simple)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Morning Reset:</strong> No phone for the first hour. Coffee first, Instagram later.</li>
        <li><strong>Nature Swap:</strong> Trade one scroll session for a mindful walk.</li>
        <li><strong>Silent Hours:</strong> Two device-free hours every evening.</li>
        <li><strong>Analog Nights:</strong> A book instead of YouTube before bed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tiny steps, big difference.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="article-conclusion">
      <h2>🌿 Final Discovery</h2>
      <p>Without screens buzzing at me 24/7, my brain finally had room to breathe — to daydream, meditate, or just stare at the ceiling without guilt. A digital detox isn’t about rejecting technology; it’s about reclaiming attention and mental space.</p>
      <p>So next time someone asks why I didn’t reply right away, I’ll just say:<br>
        <em>“Sorry, I was busy upgrading my brain to version 2.0.” 😎</em>
