        <h2>The Science Behind Slow Living</h2>
        <p>Modern neuroscience confirms that our nervous systems benefit from a slower pace. Reduced stress hormones, improved emotional regulation, and heightened mental clarity are all associated with deliberate, mindful living.</p>

        <h2>Yoga: Beyond the Physical</h2>
        <p>Yoga combines movement, breath control, and meditation. Regular practice increases GABA levels in the brain—a neurotransmitter that helps mitigate anxiety. Just 15 minutes daily can make a noticeable difference.</p>

        <h2>Nature Exposure and Cognitive Restoration</h2>
        <p>Studies show that even brief walks in green spaces reduce rumination and activate the parasympathetic nervous system. Forest bathing, a Japanese practice known as Shinrin-yoku, has become a global phenomenon for a reason—it works.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Simple Daily Practices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Start your day without screens for the first 30 minutes.</li>
          <li>Take a daily 10-minute nature walk, even in urban parks.</li>
          <li>Practice yoga or deep breathing after work instead of doom-scrolling.</li>
          <li>Establish a calming bedtime ritual, such as herbal tea and journaling.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>A Holistic Path Forward</h2>
        <p>Slow living isn’t a retreat from life—it’s a deeper engagement with it. By realigning our rhythms with nature and our breath, we create space for healing and growth. Mental wellness doesn’t always require more effort; sometimes it asks for less.</p>
